###under hood:
- watchers service: two-way data binding via dirty checking
- compile service: almost like as original angular js compile with blackjack and transclude feature :)
- parse service: expression parsing via Function constructor
- error service: base error handler
- root-scope service: almost like as original implementation. With inhretitance and isolation
- controller service: implementation of supporting "controllers" feature
- and little bit more services: log, template-url
- and base directives like: ng-repeat, events(ng-click, ng-mousedown and etc.), ng-show, ng-bind, ng-class, ng-model, ng-controller, ng-transclude, ng-bind. And of course it supports custom directives with original syntax.
